WORKING PLAN

In lieu of other documentation, this should capture the basic structure we're
looking for.

We decompose the problem into four distinct elements, which can be developed
separately:

(1) Preference estimation
(2) Population simulation
(3) Matching simulation
(4) Result consolidation

The general principle is that the four pieces should operate independently.
The goal should be to export an object that can plug itself into the next
piece. So, for example, step (1) Preference estimation should estimate
preferences, save the estimate to a file, then provide a class/interface for
loading the estimated preference parameters into (2) Population simulation.

To dig into that paragraph, note that it's not as simple as, ``Estimate logit,
then plug logit parameters into step (2).'' If we were only interested in
logit this would be fine, however we might consider alternate preference
models, or Bayesian analysis, in which case it's important that the population
simulator has [effectively] an API into the preference estimator.

As a sequence:

[use leaked SFUSD preference data to estimate preference model]

==> [save preference model]

vvv

[use Census/AHS data to simulate population of incoming kindergarteners]
+ [use preference model to simulate preferences]

==> [save set of simulated populations]

vvv

[use suggested school choice mechanisms to simulate outcomes]

==> [save set of outcomes]

vvv

[figure out set of summary statistics]
